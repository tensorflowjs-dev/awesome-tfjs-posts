## Models

### Images

- [MobileNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/mobilenet) - Classify images with labels from the [ImageNet database](http://www.image-net.org/).
- [PoseNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/posenet) - A machine learning model which allows for real-time human pose estimation in the browser. See a detailed description [here](https://medium.com/tensorflow/real-time-human-pose-estimation-in-the-browser-with-tensorflow-js-7dd0bc881cd5).
- [Coco SSD](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/coco-ssd) - Object detection model that aims to localize and identify multiple objects in a single image. Based on the [TensorFlow object detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/README.md).
- [BodyPix](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/body-pix) - Real-time person and body part segmentation in the browser using TensorFlow.js.
- [DeepLab v3](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/deeplab) - Semantic segmentation.

### Audio

- [Speech Commands](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/speech-commands) - Classify 1 second audio snippets from the [speech commands dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/sequences/audio_recognition).

### Text

- [Universal Sentence Encoder](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/universal-sentence-encoder) - Encode text into a 512-dimensional embedding to be used as inputs to natural language processing tasks such as sentiment classification and textual similarity.
- [Text Toxicity](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/toxicity) - Score the perceived impact a comment might have on a conversation, from "Very toxic" to "Very healthy".

### General Utilities

- [KNN Classifier](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/knn-classifier) - This package provides a utility for creating a classifier using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. Can be used for transfer learning.
